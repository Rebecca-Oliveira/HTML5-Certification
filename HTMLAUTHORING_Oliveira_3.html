                The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger will combine
                forces
                to create an open-source, standards-based cross-platform
                project to
                bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. “At Hyperledger,
                we’re
                very focused at building communities that build a set of software
                products and many of those touch on and implement Ethereumrelated
                standards, and the EEA is focused on driving a community of
                organizations around a common set of standards and then
                certifying
                applications against those standards,” says EEA Executive
                Director Ron Resnick.
